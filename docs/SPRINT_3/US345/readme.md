# US 345

## 1. Context

The objective of this task is to implement and deploy a plugin responsible for analyzing and validating drone programs
written in the Drone Language (DSL). This functionality is part of **Sprint 3**, aligned with the domain of drone
programming and simulation.

## 2. Requirements

**As a** Drone Tech,  
**I want** to deploy and configure a plugin to be used by the system to analyze/validate a drone program,  
**So that** we can ensure the programs are syntactically correct and ready to be used in drone simulations.

### Acceptance Criteria:

- **US345.1:** There must be a plugin for each different drone language.

### Dependencies/References:

- **US253 - Drone Programming Language Configuration:** This user story is a direct dependency. It is required to have
  the drone programming language defined in the system so it can be used by the plugin.

---

## 3. Analysis

The Drone Language is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) used to program individual drone behaviors in a show. The
language includes instructions such as `takeOff`, `land`, `move`, `blink`, etc., and allows mathematical expressions and
structured types such as `Position`, `Vector`, and arrays.

Two versions of the language currently exist:

- **DroneOne DSL** (v0.86)
- **DroneTwo DSL** (v0.666), which adds new types and instructions

Both versions share much of the core syntax but diverge in instruction sets and type names.

---

## 4. Design

The plugin is implemented using **ANTLR4**. A shared Antlr (`DroneLexer.g4 and DroneParser.g4`) was created to support both versions by
generalizing keywords and types.

### 4.1 Architecture Overview

- `DroneParder.g4`: ANTLR grammar defining lexical and syntactic structure of the language
- `DroneLangParser`, `DroneLangLexer`: Generated by ANTLR
- `DroneProgramValidator`: Main Java class that uses the parser to check program validity

The plugin exposes a method:

```java
public ValidationResult validate(String code);
```

Which returns a success status or a list of syntax errors with line/column info.

### 4.3 Acceptance Tests

#### Test 1: Valid Drone Program

**Refers to Acceptance Criteria:** _US345.1_

```java

@Test
void ensureValidDroneProgramPasses() {
    String code = "takeOff(10, 2); move((0,0,10), 1);";
    ValidationResult result = validator.validate(code);
    assertTrue(result.isSuccess());
}
```

#### Test 2: Invalid Instruction Fails

**Refers to Acceptance Criteria:** _US345.3_

```java

```

## 5. Implementation

*In this section the team should present, if necessary, some evidencies that the implementation is according to the
design. It should also describe and explain other important artifacts necessary to fully understand the implementation
like, for instance, configuration files.*

*It is also a best practice to include a listing (with a brief summary) of the major commits regarding this
requirement.*

## 6. Integration/Demonstration

*In this section the team should describe the efforts realized in order to integrate this functionality with the other
parts/components of the system*

*It is also important to explain any scripts or instructions required to execute an demonstrate this functionality*

## 7. Observations

*This section should be used to include any content that does not fit any of the previous sections.*

*The team should present here, for instance, a critical prespective on the developed work including the analysis of
alternative solutioons or related works*

*The team should include in this section statements/references regarding third party works that were used in the
development this work.*
