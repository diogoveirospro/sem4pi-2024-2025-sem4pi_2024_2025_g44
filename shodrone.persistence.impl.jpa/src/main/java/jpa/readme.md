### This is the trasactional readme file for the jpa module

### This module is responsible for the persistence of the Shodrone application using JPA (Java Persistence API).

### Everything in this module is transactional, meaning that all operations are performed within a transaction context.

### This is where the database interactions take place, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting entities.

### Every Repository in the system will have a corresponding JPA implementation that handles the database interactions.
