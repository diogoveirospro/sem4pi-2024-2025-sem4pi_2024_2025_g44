## 3. How to Build

This is only if you want to build the project. If you want to run the project, you can just run the jar file that is already built and located in the `target` folder.
If you want to build the project, you need to have the following tools installed:
- Java 21
- Maven 3.8.1

Make sure `JAVA_HOME` is set to the JDK folder and Maven is on the system `PATH`. [How to set JAVA_HOME](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/setting-the-java_home-variable-in-windows-8895.html)

To build the project, run the following script:
- **Linux/Unix/MacOS:** ./build-all.sh or ./quickbuild.sh
- **Windows:** .\build-all.bat or .\quickbuild.bat

## 4. How to Execute Tests

To run and compile the project, you need to have the programs said in the previous section *How to Build* and then run the following script:

To run the tests, run the following script:
- **Linux/Unix/MacOS:** ./run-tests.sh
- **Windows:** .\run-tests.bat

## 5. How to Run

But first, you need to run the bootstrap script to create the folders and files needed to run the project.

**Bootstrap:**

- **Linux/Unix/MacOS:** ./bootstrap.sh
- **Windows:** .\bootstrap.bat

**ShodroneBackoffice:**

- Linux/Unix/MacOS: ./shodroneBackoffice.sh

## 6. How to Install/Deploy into Another Machine (or Virtual Machine)

Go to GitHub and download or clone the repository. \
Verify if `JDK` is installed and added to the `Path`. 
[JDK Installation Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/install/installation-jdk-microsoft-windows-platforms.html#GUID-A7E27B90-A28D-4237-9383-A58B416071CA) \
Run the build scripts and then the running scripts.



## 7. How to Generate PlantUML Diagrams

**Only Linux/Unix**: You need to have Graphviz installed in your system. To install Graphviz, run the following command:

``sudo apt update`` <br>
``sudo apt install graphviz``

**Only MacOS**: You need to have Graphviz installed in your system. To install Graphviz, run the following command:

``brew install graphviz``

To generate plantuml diagrams for documentation execute the script 

- **Linux/Unix/MacOC:** ./generate-plantuml-diagrams.sh
- **Windows:** .\generate-plantuml-diagrams.bat

This will generate the diagrams in the `docs/diagrams` folder. The script will look for all `.puml` files in the `docs/diagrams` folder and generate the images in the same folder.
The images generated by the script will be in the `/images` folder for each diagram (the diagram code will be in the `/puml` package).
